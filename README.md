## Description

In the domain of stock market price prediction, we conducted a comparative analysis of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. For ML, we employed Linear Regression, a commonly used method that relies on historical data. In contrast, for DL, we harnessed the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, which are well-suited for time series data like stock prices.

We sourced data from Kaggle for Facebook and Google stock prices, enabling a direct comparison. Our experiments showed that LSTM outperformed Linear Regression in terms of accuracy and error rating. This underscores LSTM's capability to capture complex patterns in stock market data, making it a valuable tool for more precise predictions. These results highlight the growing significance of deep learning in financial analysis.
